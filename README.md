# Offensive Security Learning Journey Documentation

### 1. **Introduction to Offensive Security:**
   - **Definition:** Offensive security involves proactively identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications to improve their security posture. It focuses on simulating cyber attacks to uncover weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.
   - **Key Concepts:**
      - *Penetration Testing:* A simulated cyber attack against a system to identify security weaknesses.
      - *Red Teaming:* A comprehensive attack simulation designed to test an organization’s security defenses, often involving multiple vectors and prolonged engagement.
      - *Vulnerability Assessment:* The process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system.
      - *Exploitation:* The act of leveraging a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control over a system.
      - *Post-Exploitation:* Activities performed after gaining access to a system, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
      - *Social Engineering:* Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
      - *Reconnaissance:* The process of gathering information about a target to plan an attack.
      - *Bug Bounty Programs:* Platforms that reward individuals for discovering and reporting security vulnerabilities in software or systems.

### 2. **Core Offensive Security Concepts:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
      - *Definition:* The initial phase of an attack where information about the target is gathered.

      - *Practical Exercise:* Use Metasploit to exploit a known vulnerability in a virtual machine (e.g., Metasploitable).
   - **Post-Exploitation:**
      - *Definition:* Activities conducted after successfully exploiting a system to achieve further objectives.
      - *Key Activities:* Privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, data exfiltration.
      - *Practical Exercise:* After gaining access to a system, attempt privilege escalation using tools like `sudo` or `winPEAS`.
   - **Social Engineering:**
      - *Definition:* Tactics that exploit human psychology to bypass security controls.
      - *Types:* Phishing, Pretexting, Baiting, Tailgating.

   - **Web Application Penetration Testing:**
      - *Definition:* Assessing the security of web applications by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
      - *Key Techniques:* SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
